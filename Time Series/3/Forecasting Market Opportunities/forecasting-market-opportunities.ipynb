The purpose will be to validate market opportunities to help the Aymara indigenous people in Bolivia export alpaca wool scarves to different countries or regions.\n","\n","You’ll continue collaborating with the International Co-operative Alliance. But now, you’ll use Prophet to validate prospective market opportunities.\n","\n","## Instructions\n","\n","1. Open Google Colab and import the provided notebook.\n","\n","2. Execute the code cells in \"Step 2\" to set-up and prepare the data.\n","\n","3. Create two Prophet models, one for each country.\n","\n","4. Fit the Prophet models.\n","\n","5. Use the `make_future_dataframe` function to forecast one year of trend dates.\n","\n","   > **Hint:** Google Trends data is collected weekly. So, set the `freq` parameter to `W`, and set `periods=52` (because one year has 52 weeks).\n","\n","6.
